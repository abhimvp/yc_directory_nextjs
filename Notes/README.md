## Hero Section(Home Page)

- Also we can create a `utility` class called heading or sub-heading & then we can re-use it across pages.
- Go to `global.css` - add `@layer` - Use the @layer directive to tell Tailwind which "bucket" a set of custom styles belong to. Valid layers are base, components, and utilities - it's better to have utilities rather than having them in className.
- if you guys are getting tailwind css styling errors. try the following. delete the tailwind.config file from the root of your project. replace the code for it to work on tailwind v4.

- [Install](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) `shadcn` CLI - library to help re-use some of the components.The Foundation for your Design System.A set of beautifully designed components that you can customize, extend, and build on.
  - Use the shadcn CLI to add components to your project.
  - Use the `init` command to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.
  - The `init` command installs dependencies, adds the `cn` util and configures CSS variables for the project.
  - `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`
  - Use the `add` command to add components and dependencies to your project.

```bash
$ pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
....

- Let's build the header of our application in `app/(root)/page.tsx`

### Key Features in Your CSS File Explained

Let's break down the new at-rules from your file:

- @import "tailwindcss";
  This single line replaces the three old directives (@tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, @tailwind utilities;). It's the new, all-in-one entry point for all of Tailwind's styles.

- @theme { ... }
  This is the biggest change. The @theme block is the direct replacement for your tailwind.config.ts file. You define all your design tokens—colors, fonts, breakpoints, etc.—as CSS custom properties.

--color-primary: #ee2b69; in @theme automatically creates utility classes like bg-primary, text-primary, etc.

--breakpoint-xs: 475px; creates the xs: responsive modifier.

- @plugin "..."
  This is the new, simplified way to include official Tailwind CSS plugins like tailwindcss-animate and @tailwindcss/typography.

- @utility ... { ... }
  This is a new, more concise way to create your own custom utility classes. It replaces the old syntax: @layer utilities { .class-name { @apply ... } }. It's essentially a dedicated at-rule for creating reusable styles with @apply.

Old Way (v3):

```CSS
@layer utilities {
.profile_container {
@apply w-full pb-10 pt-20;
}
}
```

New Way (v4):

```CSS

@utility profile_container {
@apply w-full pb-10 pt-20;
}
```

- A word of caution: Because Tailwind v4 is in alpha, its syntax and features are still subject to change before the final release. It's fantastic for learning and personal projects, but be mindful when using it for production applications.

## Theming & Fonts

- Every website also has it's unique themes and font's.
- let's setup tailwind [config](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/yc_directory?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-snippets).
- `pnpm add tailwindcss-animate` & `pnpm add @tailwindcss/typography`
- we will use `app/layout.tsx` to setup the right font's. currently we're using google fonts now. but it is preferable to have them hosted locally - get them from [in-here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OEFHnEq5pQFP86u8FOBLBBNxKPsbjjqU/view).
- `localFont` allowing you to not depend on external services.

## Implement Auth in Navbar

- Style it a bit - refer code & offline notes on what is what.
- Remove the files in public folder.
- Get the logo from Figma
- [Server Action to a form](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions#server-functions-with-actions) & [from next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms)
- Our setup looks like this now:
  ![alt text](images/image-1.png)

## Improve our File and Folder Structure before implementing Authentication

- let's create a new `Route Group` - `(root)` - which will be our `Home Page`. Move our `app/page.tsx` into `(root)/page.tsx` & also create a `layout.tsx` file -> means what we apply to this layout will only be applied to the pages within this route group.
- create `components` folder in `app` directory and create a `Navbar.tsx` component which we will add in `layout.tsx`. if you got to localhost -> you will be able to see `Navbar` at the top and `HOME` below it.
- Right within the Navbar we will implement our NextAuth.

## Starting with Authentication using Auth.js

- [Official Doc](https://authjs.dev/) - which is also known as NextAuth.
- [Installation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation):
  - #1 -> Installing Auth.js
  - #2 -> Setup Environment : The only environment variable that is mandatory is the AUTH_SECRET. This is a random value used by the library to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes. -> Creates a new `.env.local` file with `AUTH_SECRET`.
  - #DOIT -> Implement our configuration: create the Auth.js config file and object. This is where you can control the behavior of the library and specify custom authentication logic, adapters, etc. We recommend all frameworks to create an auth.ts file in the project.
    - create a new `auth.ts` file at the root of your app
    - Add a Route Handler under `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
      - create a the following folders in order under `app` directory/Folder -> `api` FOLDER-> `auth` FOLDER -> `[..nextauth]` FOLDER -> `route.ts` FILE
    - For now `Skipping` : Add optional Middleware to keep the session alive.
    - Setup Authentication Methods: we’ll setup the first authentication methods and fill out that `providers` array - At this point, `you need to decide how you’re gonna authenticate users in your application`. Auth.js supports four main authentication paradigm.
      - We will go with `OAuth`: Recommended because `OAuth services spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build abuse detection (bot-protection, rate-limiting), password management (password reset, credential stuffing, rotation), data security (encryption/salting, strength validation), and much more.`
      - We will go with `Github` which one of the popular provider for Authentication.
      - When registering an OAuth application on GitHub, they will all ask you to enter your application’s callback URL.
      - In our case, we need to set it up from scratch - Let's go to `connections` -> `providers` -> [Github](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/github) - here we get all the information on how we can create a new GitHub OAuth App - which we need for the setup. For more instructions head over to this [DOC](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) - steps needed to create a GITHUB OAuth APP.`http://localhost:3000`
        ![alt text](images/image.png)
        - Copy the generated `ClientID` & add it to `.env.local` - add it as `AUTH_GITHUB_ID & AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`
        - You can also add your app-logo by referring to the complete figma design for this project
        - We will revisit this page again at the end of the course with our new deployed URL.
        - Copy the `configuration` code and add it to our `auth.ts` file - updating our existing file and add a `GITHUB` Provider.
- So How do we make it work? : Go to `app/Page.tsx` & remove all the default code. just add a fragment & HOME text.

```bash
#1
pnpm add next-auth@beta
#2
$ npx auth secret
Need to install the following packages:
auth@1.2.3
Ok to proceed? (y) y

📝 Created C:\Users\abhis\Desktop\NextJs Projects\yc_directory_nextjs\.env.local with `AUTH_SECRET`.
#3

```

## Enforcing Dependency Versions

- If we go to `package.json` - we see we're using latest version of react,react-dom & nextjs & we also need to make sure all the other packages & dependencies we use such as `NextAuth` also use those latest versions & not go back to using react18. So we add Two additional properties in `package.json`.

```json
"packageManager": "pnpm@10.10.0",
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "react": "$react",
      "react-dom": "$react-dom"
    }
  },
```

- Then start our server:

```bash
abhis@Tinku MINGW64 ~/Desktop/NextJs Projects/yc_directory_nextjs (main)
$ pnpm run dev

> yc_directory_nextjs@0.1.0 dev C:\Users\abhis\Desktop\NextJs Projects\yc_directory_nextjs
> next dev --turbopack

   ▲ Next.js 15.5.3 (Turbopack)

   - Network:      http://192.168.29.186:3000

## Removed Default `README.md` Content

````txt
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
